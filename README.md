- 👋 Hi, I’m @nikolaz90
- I'm working on a content management system for a small organisation.
- My go to tools are React and Ruby on Rails, either as individual projects or as 2 separate apps for one project.
- 🌱 I’m open to collaborating on Rails monolith or Rails api projects with a JS frontend. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with a backend/sql focus, involving data from the job market, economy or games, family life/parenthood
- 📫 How to reach me ... drop me a line!
